~~ Still in-development, more motor learning integration coming, but useful as a start ~~

This basic script generates a driving range practice session for golfers that specifies the clubs and number of hits for each club. The goal of the Swing List is to follow motor learning principles to produce a more useful practice session than constant, blocked practice. The schedule is created based on the user inputs of number of balls to hit and variability level (Low, Medium, High).

A higher variability is representative of less blocked practice in the Swing List, more pronounced switching between clubs, with fewer blocked hits at each club.
